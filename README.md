My name is Moritz Kammerer, and this is my GitHub page.

I do backend development at [qaware](https://github.com/qaware) for a living. I code mostly on the JVM with Java and Kotlin.

# Repositories

The (in my mind) most interesting repos are:

## Applications

* [sonarqube-to-prometheus](https://github.com/phxql/sonarqube-to-prometheus) - Exports SonarQube metrics to Prometheus. You can then use Grafana to visualize them or define alerts
* [mr-canary](https://github.com/phxql/mr-canary) - A TCP reverse proxy with canaries built in. No Kubernetes needed!
* [maven-to-plantuml](https://github.com/phxql/maven-to-plantuml) - Plots a graph showing your module dependencies in a Maven build
* [vhd-compact](https://github.com/phxql/vhd-compact) - Compacts dynamically sized Windows Disk Images (VHDs)

## Libraries

* [argon2-jvm](https://github.com/phxql/argon2-jvm) - Argon2 password hashing algorithm for the JVM using JNA to call a C library
* [argon2-playground](https://github.com/phxql/argon2-playground) - Small showcase to demonstrate Argon2 password hashing without the need of a C library
* [wiremock-junit5](https://github.com/phxql/wiremock-junit5) - Remember the WireMock JUnit rule? This library is exactly this, only for JUnit 5
* [snowflake-id](https://github.com/phxql/snowflake-id) - Generates 64 bit ids which are roughly sortable across multiple systems without a central instance.

## Tools

* [kotlin-one-epub](https://github.com/phxql/kotlin-one-epub) - Small helper script to download the Kotlin documentation and create a epub so that you can read the Kotlin documentation on your ebook reader

## Misc 

* [java-maven-skeleton](https://github.com/phxql/java-maven-skeleton) - A preconfigured maven project with sane defaults. I use this as a starting point for new projects
* [plantuml-templates](https://github.com/phxql/plantuml-templates) - Better looking PlantUML templates if you want to document your stuff
